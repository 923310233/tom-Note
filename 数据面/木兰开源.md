PostMan: Rapidly Mitigating Bursty Traffic by Offloading Packet Processing

https://toscode.gitee.com/opencloudnext/PostMan



## 摘要

由于某些突发事件（例如，社交网络上的spotlight新闻或特价商品出售）而导致的突发流量可能会导致后端服务严重的负载失衡。

迁移热数据（实现负载均衡的标准方法）在处理这种意外的负载不均衡时遇到了挑战，因为迁移数据会降低已经承受沉重压力的服务器的速度。

本文提出了PostMan，an alternative approach to rapidly mitigate load imbalance for services processing small requests. 

（由于观察到处理大数据包比处理小数据包所产生的CPU开销少得多），PostMan deploys a number of middleboxes called helpers to **assemble small packets into large ones** for the heavily-loaded server. 

这种方法实质上将数据包处理的开销从负载较重的服务器转移到了其他服务器。为了最大程度地减少开销，PostMan仅在检测到突发流量时才按需激活助手。

To tolerate helper failures, PostMan can migrate connections across helpers and can ensure packet ordering despite such migration. 



借助PostMan，Memcached服务器可以在数百毫秒内缓解突发流量，而数据迁移则需要数十秒的时间，并增加了迁移期间的延迟。





## 1 Introduction

现代分布式系统通常通过对数据进行分区并将这些分区分配给不同的服务器

In such an architecture, some servers may experience a higher load than others, creating a classic load imbalance problem.

许多工作已经研究了如何通过更好的数据分区和放置策略placement strategy来减轻负载不平衡，which work well for long-term and stable load imbalance.

对于突发流量导致的负载不平衡，这些方法面临另一个挑战：为了适应这种意外的负载不平衡，我们需要通过将热数据迁移到不太繁忙的服务器上来在线调整数据分区或放置策略 but migrating hot data will **inevitably slow down the server** hosting hot data— this is the server we want to accelerate. 这意味着要减轻负载不平衡，这些方法**首先会在一段时间内加剧负载不平衡**，这是生产系统通常不愿承担的**风险**。



本文提出了PostMan，这是一种缓解方法，可减轻正在处理小数据包的服务的负载不平衡，这通常会增加数据包处理的开销。

Typical examples of such services include key-value stores and metadata servers. 

For example, Facebook reported that in its caching layer, most key sizes are under 40 bytes and median value size is 135 bytes;  metadata servers, such as NameNode in HDFS, are usually processing packets with a size of tens to a few hundred bytes.





PostMan的核心思想是，通过观察发现，处理大/小数据包之间的开销之间存在巨大差距，**因为网络堆栈必须为每个数据包支付固定的开销，例如中断处理和系统调用**。

例如，在10Gb以太网上处理64B数据包时，Linux可以实现2.4 Gbps的吞吐量，CPU利用率为800％。相反，当处理64KB数据包时，Linux可以实现9.1Gbps的吞吐量，而CPU利用率仅为220％。

Newer networking stacks, **such as mTCP  and IX**, have mitigated this problem, but first, the gap still exists, though smaller, and second, a wide deployment of a new networking stack requires a big effort, because the networking stack is a critical component of the whole system.



middlebox带来的好处：

- PostMan does not require the time-consuming data migration. Instead, it only requires the clients to reconnect to the helpers, which can be completed within hundreds of milliseconds as shown in our evaluation. 

- Second, PostMan can incrementally deploy new networking stacks on helpers and allow other servers to still use traditional stacks. 

- Third, PostMan can use multiple helpers to accelerate one helpee, which means its capabil- ity is not limited by the power of a single machine. 



当然，PostMan有其自身的局限性：如果负载不平衡现象持续很长时间，则PostMan将比数据迁移更昂贵，因为合并帮助程序会导致额外的数据传输和额外的服务器资源。因此，我们希望PostMan和数据迁移可以互补以减轻负载不平衡：对于意外的突发流量，我们可以激活PostMan来首先加速高负载的服务器。如果这种突发事件持续定期发生，我们可以在机器不太忙时迁移数据；

#### Batching small packets： 

A classic method to improve the performance of processing small packets is to batch them to amortize the constant overhead across multiple packets. 

For example, TCP has the Nagle’s algorithm to batch small pack- ets. Modern NICs often use Generic Receive Offload (GRO) to re-segment the received packets. 

However, the power of such per-connection batching mechanisms is limited by the number of outstanding packets per client. In many cases, a client may have to wait for replies before it can issue new ones and thus the number of packets that can be batched is limited.



#### Efficient network stack. 

There is a continuous effort to develop more efficient network stacks for high-speed net- works: mTCP moves the TCP stack to the user space to **reduce system call overhead** and further improves perfor- mance by batching I/Os; 

DPDK [1] asks a network card to transfer data to the user space directly and applies a series of optimizations like CPU affinity, huge page, and polling to get close to bare-metal speed; 

IX [8] and Arrakis [43] design new operating systems to separate data transfer and access control to achieve both high speed and good protection; 

Netmap [46] improves networking performance by reducing memory allocation, system call, and data copy overhead; 

many works [12, 22, 25, 26, 30–32, 44, 48, 49, 51] exploit the RDMA technique and FPGA to improve networking perfor- mance.





PostMan的架构类似于现有的代理（例如NGINX [45]和mcrouter [38]），它们也部署在客户端和服务器之间。与一个叫做split TCP的系统不同，, Post- Man’s helpers actually delay sending *ack*s to the sender, until the helpers receive *ack*s from the helpee





## 3 Overview of PostMan

1) a number of helper nodes that assemble small packets for the helpees, 

2) a PostMan library that provides the applications with the functionalities of packet re-direction, assembly, and disassembly. Furthermore, PostMan library provides functions to detect out-of-order packets and re-transmit packets when necessary. These functions allow PostMan to achieve fault tolerance and load balance by migrating connections across helpers.
